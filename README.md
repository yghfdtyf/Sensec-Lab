In the field of embodied intelligence, the new ultrasonic injection attack system and the corresponding defense solutions we designed have broad application prospects. Firstly, the embodied intelligent system we have constructed applies large language models to task planning and execution, providing an efficient and coordinated solution for the interaction ability and task execution of intelligent robots. This system can not only play a significant role in scenarios such as home assistant robots and smart factory robots, but also be extended to fields like healthcare and education, providing more intelligent and personalized services.
